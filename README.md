# Segmentation-of-Plasma-Cells-in-Microscopic-Images-for-Multiple-Myeloma-Diagnosis
This project investigates deep learning and medical imaging, focusing on cellular structure segmentation in Multiple Myeloma (MM). This methodology includes, combining digital image processing with deep learning techniques like median filtering, watershed segmentation, and U-Net architectures. Using the IEEE ISBI 2021 Challenge SegPC-2021 dataset,  the images were preprocessed to segment the nucleus and cytoplasm. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, highlighting the robustness of U-Net in intricate medical image analysis.
