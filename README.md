This project investigates computer vision and medical imaging, focusing on cellular structure segmentation in Multiple Myeloma (MM). This methodology combines image processing techniques like median filtering, watershed segmentation, and U-Net architectures. Using the IEEE ISBI 2021 Challenge SegPC-2021 dataset, the images were preprocessed to segment the nucleus and cytoplasm. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, highlighting the robustness of U-Net in intricate medical image analysis.
The SegPC-2021 Challenge aims to advance AI-based models for cancer diagnosis by providing a dataset of stained, color-normalized images for the segmentation of plasma cell cancer, specifically Multiple Myeloma. The dataset includes diverse cell structures, with variations in nucleus and cytoplasm amounts, and cells appearing in clusters or isolated. This variability poses challenges for accurate segmentation, making the dataset a valuable resource for developing and testing robust segmentation algorithms.
